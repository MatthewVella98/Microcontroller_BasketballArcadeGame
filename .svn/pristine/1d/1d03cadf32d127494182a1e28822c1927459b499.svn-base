\section{Closure}
\par{To recap, all the work was divided between all members of the group. Minute-taking and the writing of agendas are to be done by weekly-rotations between group members and detailed goals are listed during each meeting. As the requirements of the system were set out, the needed peripherals are: Joystick and proximity sensor for digital input; 7-segment, LED lights and speakers for Digital output; and an LCD screen as an external peripheral. }
\linebreak

\par{By evaluating the group performance weekly, the team feels that they're on the right track and moving forward as a group. The project seems very interesting and all members are keen to learn and challenge themselves. 
By the end of this project, they hope to have a much greater understanding of coding low level microcontrollers, make better use of SVN and enhance their groupwork skills, especially through the Agile Development Cycle.
